# SRI-Modeling-Thingy

did a bit of messing around with SRI models, and just infectious disease models in general for my biology final. I'm not sure how to verify this code is correct, I tested some plots, had the x,y coords for each of the 's', 'r', and 'i' printed, where I then used easy python libs to visualize, and it seemed pretty similiar to what I found in google images, who knows tho
